# AppFlowy Chrome Extension Web Clipping Prompt

## Objective
Develop a Chrome extension for AppFlowy that enables users to scrape the current web page, including its URL, metadata (such as title, author, and publication date if available), and content, and add it to AppFlowy with a single click. The extension should integrate seamlessly with AppFlowy's workspace structure, providing a powerful tool for users to save and organize web content directly into their AppFlowy environment.

## Key Features
The extension should incorporate the following features to ensure a robust and user-friendly web clipping experience:

- **One-Click Capture**: Allow users to save an entire web page effortlessly with a single click from the Chrome toolbar or context menu.
- **Destination Control**: Enable users to select specific AppFlowy workspaces, pages, or databases as the destination for the clipped content, ensuring organized storage.
- **Precision Clipping**: Support selective content capture, allowing users to highlight specific text, images, or sections of a page to save rather than the entire page.
- **Metadata Inclusion**: Automatically extract and include metadata such as the page title, URL, author, publication date, and other relevant information available from the web page.
- **Formatting Preservation**: Ensure the saved content retains the original formatting (e.g., headings, bold text, links) as much as possible for readability in AppFlowy.
- **Annotation Support**: Provide an option for users to add custom notes, tags, or comments to the clipped content during the saving process for better context or categorization.

## User Experience Goals
The extension should prioritize a seamless and intuitive user experience, mirroring the ease of use found in leading web clipping tools:

- **Minimal Setup**: Require little to no configuration for first-time users, with automatic integration with AppFlowy upon installation.
- **Context Menu Access**: Offer a context menu option (right-click) for quick clipping of selected content or entire pages directly from the browser.
- **Preview Option**: Display a preview of the clipped content and metadata before saving, allowing users to confirm or adjust the data being sent to AppFlowy.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide clear feedback (e.g., a success notification) once content is saved to AppFlowy, ensuring users know the action was completed.

## Technical Considerations
The development of this extension should address the following technical aspects to ensure functionality and compatibility:

- **AppFlowy Integration**: Utilize AppFlowy's API (if available) or other integration methods to push scraped data directly into the user's AppFlowy workspace. Ensure compatibility with both local-first and cloud-based storage models if applicable.
- **Web Page Parsing**: Implement robust parsing logic to handle various web page structures, extracting content and metadata accurately across different websites.
- **Site-Specific Formatting**: Develop special formatting rules for popular websites (e.g., Wikipedia, Twitter, news outlets) to optimize content presentation in AppFlowy, similar to Notion's approach.
- **Security and Privacy**: Ensure that the extension handles user data securely, with permissions limited to necessary web content and AppFlowy access, respecting user privacy.
- **Performance**: Optimize the extension to minimize impact on browser performance, ensuring quick scraping and saving operations even for content-heavy pages.

## Inspiration from Existing Solutions
This extension should draw inspiration from successful web clipping tools like Notion and Obsidian to combine simplicity with advanced functionality:

- **Notion Web Clipper**: Emulate the one-click capture and destination control features of Notion's official clipper, which allows users to save content directly to specific pages or databases with minimal effort.
- **Copy To Notion (Third-Party)**: Incorporate advanced features like precision clipping, multi-item capture, and automated field mapping for databases, enhancing user control over saved content.
- **Obsidian Web Clipping**: Consider Obsidian's markdown-focused approach for users who prefer local storage, ensuring the extension can save content in a format compatible with AppFlowy's structure.

## Workflow Example
Below is an example workflow for how the extension should operate, ensuring a clear user journey from clipping to saving:

1. **Initiate Clipping**: User clicks the extension icon or uses the context menu on a web page to start the clipping process.
2. **Scrape Content**: The extension scrapes the page content, including full text or selected elements, along with metadata like title and URL.
3. **Select Destination**: A popup or interface appears, allowing the user to choose the AppFlowy workspace or page for saving, and optionally add notes or tags.
4. **Preview and Confirm**: User sees a preview of the clipped content and metadata, with the option to edit or confirm before saving.
5. **Save to AppFlowy**: Content is pushed to the selected AppFlowy location via API or integration method.
6. **Receive Confirmation**: User receives a notification confirming the content has been saved successfully.

This prompt aims to guide the creation of a comprehensive AppFlowy Chrome extension that meets user needs for efficient web content capture and organization, rivaling the capabilities of leading tools in the market.
